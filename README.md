# Learning Multiple Attractors with Reservoir Computing
This project implements the methods described in the paper:  
**[Learning Multiple Attractors with Reservoir Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxxxxx)**.  
This project proposes a novel scheme of Reservoir Computing (RC) capable of learning multiple attractors generated by entirely different dynamics, referred to as Multi-Functional Reservoir Computing (MFRC). By incorporating a label channel into the standard RC, a single machine is able to learn the dynamics of multiple chaotic attractors from data, and each attractor can be accurately retrieved by inputting just a scalar in the prediction phase.

## Features

- **Multi-Attractor Learning**: The model can learn and memorize multiple chaotic attractors.
- **Label Channel**: A label channel is added to the RC to differentiate between the learned attractors during the retrieval phase.
- **Efficient Prediction**: With just a scalar input, the machine can accurately predict and reconstruct any of the trained attractors.
- **Multi-dimensional Attractors**: The model supports attractors of different dimensions, demonstrating flexibility in handling diverse chaotic systems.

## Experiments

### Fig 1(b) Experiments

The code implements the memory and reconstruction of four attractors as described in Figure 1(b) of the paper. The training process involves optimizing the hyperparameters and the output weight matrix (`W_out`). After training, the test phase uses these optimized configurations to evaluate the performance of the reservoir computing (RC) model in reconstructing the attractors.

- **train**: This folder contains the scripts for training and validating the RC model. It handles the training process, optimizing the hyperparameters and `W_out` to ensure the model can accurately memorize and reconstruct the four attractors.
  
- **test_plot**: This folder contains the scripts for evaluating the performance of the trained RC model. It uses the optimized hyperparameters and `W_out` generated during training to reconstruct the attractors and visualize the results, enabling performance evaluation.

### Fig 7 Experiments

The code also implements the memory and reconstruction of attractors across three different dimensions, as described in Figure 7 of the paper. The structure is similar to the experiments conducted for Figure 1(b).

- **train**: This folder contains scripts for training and validating the RC model on attractors of different dimensions. Similar to the process in Figure 1(b), this phase optimizes hyperparameters and `W_out` to ensure the model can memorize and reconstruct attractors across varying dimensions.

- **test_plot**: This folder contains the scripts for testing the RC model's performance after training on the different attractor dimensions. Using the optimized parameters from the training phase, the model is configured to reconstruct the attractors and measure performance, providing visualizations of the results.
